            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello I am Kevin Tripi. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Oakland University, I have a keen interest in the study of UI/UX designs. My Interest in UX began after spending two years at Macomb Community College, where I developed an academic art base before transferring to Oakland University in Fall 2022. Now, I'm at Oakland University to persue a technical degree to combine both skilsets of art and IT. My passion for UI/UX design is driven by a desire to make stuff more user-friendly and intuitive.
                <br><br>
            Throughout my academic career, I have complemented my studies with design-related coursework, aiming to continuously enhance my skills in this area. Additionally, I have embraced leadership opportunities that have come my way, such as a Resident Assistant at Oakland University, to develop a well-rounded skill set.
